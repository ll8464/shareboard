# What is dev.localhost?

Hello! This project is a message board complete with login. It was made with the intention of practicing php and MVC framework.
To that end, this is a MVC framework that I made for this project.
The technologies used were php, bootstrap, mySQL, and apache. The web server solution I chose was xampp.
